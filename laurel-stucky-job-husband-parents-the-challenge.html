Laurel first appeared in the Challenge universe as a Fresh Meat in 2009. Darrell chose her with the first overall pick after she excelled in the Fresh Meat combine. The draft was then redone for whatever reason, and Darrell was selected first instead of Cara Maria. Kenny then chose Laurel as his second choice overall.</p><p>Does Laurel have a husband? Who are her parents? Read all about her in this article here.</p><h3><strong>The Challenge: Laurel Stucky Job</strong></h3><p>Laurel Stucky aspired to have a job as a veterinarian and studied Pre-Veterinary Medicine. She also holds a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish.</p><p>Laurel also aspired to be a musician. She is a self-taught vocalist, writer, and guitar player. Further explaining about her tastes and favorite musician she wrote, ” My favorite artists are Dolly Parton, Richard Gere, Jack Nicholson, Pocahontas (fictional but favorite,) & Julie Andrews. The music that speaks to me I would label: Soul, Folk, Caribbean, Rock, Hip-Hop, Country, and some Pop. However, I hate specifying genres because my taste in music is not limited to only these categories. ”</p><p>Find Laurel’s music <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Laurel had previously appeared on MTV’s Real World. About that, she shared, “After college, I sent in a tape for MTV’s The Real World because in high school someone told me I would be great on that show. I did not get cast on The Real World, but later got asked to participate in The Real World/Road Rules Challenge (now renamed: The Challenge), I feel comfortable competing and I was eager to take that opportunity at the time. (I was also young, and stupid.)”</p><p>Laurel finished her high school at Lahser High School. She graduated from Michigan State University in 2007 where she played volleyball.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Laurel Stucky Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>As of 2023, Laurel Stucky’s net worth is above $350 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Laurel Stucky Husband</strong></h3><p>Laurel Stucky is not married so she doesn’t have a husband. But, her relationship with Jordan Wiseley caught her attention time and again.</p><p>The Challenge: Free Agents premiered in the spring of 2014, while filming began during the holidays in 2013. In March, it looked like their connection was more than just a show. Jordan captioned a photo of him and Laurel kissing, “Oh snap, hope my gf doesn’t get mad at this.”</p><p>Laurel responded to the tweet with “LOL,” while fans of the series cheered on their relationship. One user wrote, “Best couple + players! Hope y’all the best and hope ya’ll are still dating.” They declared that they were still dating and making the long-distance relationship work during the reunion episode, which aired in June.</p><p>But that was the last time we heard from Laurel and Jordan. Jordan flew down to Panama as a contender in Battle of the Exes 2 when he returned to The Challenge. Laurel did not. He was paired with Sarah Rice, with whom Jordan had a brief relationship during Rivals II. Sarah and Jordan won the season after crushing the final course in Norway. Following that, both Laurel and Jordan left the show, and it’s probable that most Challenge viewers have forgotten they ever existed.</p><p>Laurel returned to the program in a big way during Invasion of the Champions, where she came out as bisexual and briefly dated Nicole Zanatta. However, War of the Worlds II is Jordan’s first return to the series since Dirty XXX.</p><p>When fellow cast members Jenna Compono and Zach Nichols married on 2 April 2022, Laurel and Jordan made headlines by appearing cozy with each other.</p><p>On Reddit, fans of MTV’s The Challenge saw a few posts implying Jordan and Laurel were getting close during Jenna Compono and Zach Nichols’ wedding. A Reddit user pointed out that Nany González’s Instagram Stories showed a large group of Challenge cast members sharing a hotel room. Jordan can be seen sitting by Laurel with his arms around her in one of the Instagram Stories. Laurel is on the ground.</p><p>“They’re all sharing a hotel room it seems (Nany, Marie, Kaycee, Jordan, and Laurel) and at the end of her story, she’s turning the camera to show everyone and you see Laurel and Jordan being all really close, and cuddly,” the Reddit user wrote. “Is it just me or does it seem flirtatious to anyone else?”</p><p>“They actually dated for a year outside the show,” another Redditor added. “Jordan said so on a podcast.”</p><p>“If you watch Laurel’s story, she posted a photo in sweats and the vest Jordan wore while driving in Ukraine,” another Reddit user wrote. “All this is easy to read into but is not definitive proof.”</p><p>She was also allegedly linked to Nicole Zanatta and Stephen Bear.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Laurel Stucky?</strong></h3><p>Laurel Stucky’s date of birth is June 1985.
