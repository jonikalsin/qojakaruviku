At this point, the weatherman had been with the morning team at WBZ for nearly four years. The most he became famous was back in 2020 for hilariously getting caught dancing on camera. So, at a time when he decides to put an end to his era at WBZ, we thought we would bring to you a tell-all about his his wife.</p><h3><strong>Meet Lauren Mindel, WBZ Weatherman Zack Green’s Wife</strong></h3><p>Lauren Mindel has been WBZ Weatherman Zack’s wife since 20 October 2018. On that day the two got married, Zack shared that he and his beautiful wife were surrounded by their closest friends and family just outside of Asheville, North Carolina. Zack once told his people on social media that their wedding day started out as a day full of rain and turned into the most memorable, gorgeous day of his life.</p><p>Zack also has spoken about meeting his person in a dance battle at an Irish pub on St. Paddy’s Day, a long time ago on 17 March 2013. That day Zack said his life changed for good. Also, since that day, Zack is not the only one who has been writing shoutouts to his wife, but it is also the other way around. Lauren, for instance, has time and again appreciated her husband’s&nbsp;behind-the-scenes hard work and dedication at home and at work.</p><p>Most lately, on 30 September 2023, WBZ This Morning ended that day’s program with a sendoff to Zack. Following this, Zack indicated that he had been let go because of the network’s “new direction.” As for his fans, they theorized this move with some wondering if perhaps the program would be replacing all people with ChatGPT and some animations.</p><h3><strong>Lauren Mindel And Zack Green Baby</strong></h3><p>Zack Green’s fans for some time now have been aware of him being a girl dad.</p><p>Zack and Lauren celebrated their baby Skylar “Sky” Raye’s nine-month-old birthday on 18 July 2023. A month before, Zack had taken to social media to share with people that his first Father’s Day was the best. “Skylar, being your dad is the most incredible thing in the world. And Lauren, you make all these dreams a reality. Thank you my loves❤️”, he wrote next to pictures and video clips of him and Sky having a blast.</p><p>In March 2023, Zack also showed us a look at one of their many dad-daughter brunch dates when he asked for Eggs Benedict for himself and the Gerber special for the little lady accompanying him.</p><h3><strong>Lauren Mindel Age</strong></h3><p>Lauren T Mindel was born in 1991.

They were based in Irvine, California.</p><p>Speaking of Katie, who is originally from Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, she has been self-employed since 10 November 2018. Back in the day, she studied Fashion Institute at Pennsylvania State University.</p><p>Lauren also has two siblings, a brother and a sister.</p><p>Alexander J Mindel, AKA AJ Mindel, her brother, turned 35 in July 2023. At this point, he had been residing in <span>Yorba Linda, California. Then, there is</span>&nbsp;Jessie Mindel, Lauren’s baby sister who turned 26 in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Lauren Mindel Job</strong></h3><p>According to LinkedIn, Lauren Mindel has been working as the director of business development at Viking Cruises in Boston, Massachusetts since 2021.
