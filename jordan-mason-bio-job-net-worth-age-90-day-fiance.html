Jordan Mason and Everton were one of those pairs, both new to TLC viewers.</p><p>As seen in the show, Jordan is a nudist, and Everton is a little more conservative. The two have been in a long-distance relationship for 12 years and there is a 10-year age gap between them. And while Jordan is an American, Everton happens to be Jamaican. In addition to all these differences, their relationship before they decided to place on a reality show was such that Everton came to know Jordan has been using her for money, and might be cheating on her with another woman.</p><p>Let us tell you all of it and if or not they are still together in the rest of the writing. This ‘Jordan Mason Bio’ is less about Jordan and Everton’s relationship and more about Jordan, her age, job, net worth, and more.</p><h3><strong>90 Day Fiance: Are Jordan Mason And Everton Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Jordan Mason And Everton are presumably still together post-90&nbsp;Day Fiance.</p><p>There is no official confirmation of that. Fans have just wanted to believe so because of how long they have been with each other and from the way they were portrayed on the reality show. They seem to share a deep bond and despite the highs and lows, they seemed to be wanting to put their efforts in.</p><p>To the cameras on the show, Jordan reveals that she has been together with Everton of Portland, Jamaica for over 12 years. Theirs, she also reveals, has been an on-again-off-again relationship. In fact, according to her they even tried to date other people, but their mutual attraction forced them to return to each other in the end.</p><p>When it was Everton’s turn, he also gushed that Jordan has always been the only constant in his life.</p><p>The most important thing is that although not already engaged, the couple were seen calling themselves each other’s betrothed. They gave quite a vibe that they are committed to spending a lifetime together. Yet, there were also not so merrily confessions. In a teaser for the season, Jordan was seen getting mad at Everton and yelling at him “You were taking money from me and you were giving it to another woman?”. “A small amount, yes”, Everton had replied.</p><p>The money issue was one of the few things the couple seem to be having problems with.</p><p>In another scene, Jordan’s family appeared unhappy with her since she bought a piece of land in Grand Cayman before giving Everton power of attorney over it.</p><p>On the show, we also see Jordan tell the story that she met Everton when she was attending a friend’s wedding in Grand Cayman. The wedding party had decided to charter a boat, and Everton was the captain of that very boat. She said they hit it off immediately. Once the wedding ceremony ended, Jordan was forced to return to the States. And so she did that promising to keep in touch with him.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Mason Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, when Jordan Mason decided to take the 90 Day Fiancé Love in Paradise&nbsp;experiment, she was 38 years old.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Mason Job</strong></h3><p>Originally, Jordan Mason worked as an eyelash extension artist in the beauty industry. But, once the Covid-19 pandemic happened, it severely affected Texas’ beauty industry. And Jordan, like many others, was forced to change careers.</p><p>So, fast forward to today, she has chosen to make money making custom fetish videos online. She even said on the show that she takes pride in the fact that her work helps others live out their fantasies.</p><p>Jordan also opened up that she was always fascinated by the nudist way of life from a young age, and even though her parents were skeptical about it initially, she said, she adopted the lifestyle once she came of age.</p><p>Everton meanwhile seemed to have no idea of those videos that Jordan made.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Jordan Mason’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Jordan Mason reportedly had less than an estimated $300K net worth as of April 2023.</p><p>Per intouchweekly.com, 90 Day Fiancé pays their cast members $1,000 to $1,500 per episode, a little more if they land a place on Happily Ever After? Jordan also should have taken home a paycheque accordingly.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Mason Height</strong></h3><p>Jordan Mason stands below 5’6” in height.</p><p>If you also need to know, she received her first BBL in March 2023.
