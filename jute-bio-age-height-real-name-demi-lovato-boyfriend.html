In her short note, Demi called Jute$ the “best boyfriend” and mentioned how grateful she is to have him in her life. Lovato wrote, “YOURE THE BEST BOYFRIEND IN THE WORLD. I’m just so grateful I get to call you mine because I’ve never laughed like this in my life, I’ve never smiled so much and my heart is constantly so full of love w you. this post, this caption… how are YOU real?! I love you honey.. so much.”</p><p>The couple was seen holding hands over the weekend at Santa Monica, California’s Giorgio Baldi, a popular hangout for celebrities. In a red mini dress, black leather jacket, fishnet stockings, and black shoes, Lovato made a statement. While her boyfriend wore a sleeveless studded sweater and a bucket hat, the birthday lady finished her ensemble with dark sunglasses and a handbag in the same color.</p><p>Page Six was informed by a source that the couple “stuck to water only” and held hands as they exited the restaurant. “They were snuggling and sneaking kisses throughout their meal,” the source added.</p><p>The couple recently went public with their relationship. They stepped out for a date in New York City on 16 August. An eyewitness told E! News that the pair “looked extremely happy” while walking hand in hand together. A source close to the Camp Rock star told the outlet that the former Disney star and the “OUT THE DOOR” singer&nbsp;have been “secretly dating for months now.”</p><p>“Things are going really well and they have a lot in common, the insider shared on Aug. 18. “They bond over music.” &nbsp;“She’s definitely smitten,” the insider explained. “Everyone thinks he is really good for her.”</p><p>The lovebirds met while collaborating on multiple songs off her latest album. Lovato furthered her and Jute$’s relationship by including a number of stories from Jute$ in her Instagram Story.</p><p>After Jute$ noted he was “unbelievably proud” of his significant other’s “timeless album,” the singer replied, “Thank you so much baby!!!! I’m so grateful for the songs we created and soooo grateful you’re mine.”</p><p>The relationship came after two years of Demi’s split from her ex-fiance Max Ehrich.</p><h3><strong>Jute$ Age</strong></h3><p>As of late August of 2022, Jute$ is 24 years old.</p><h3><strong>Jute$ Real Name</strong></h3><p>The real name of Jute$ is Jordan Lutes.</p><h3><strong>Is Jute$ On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Jute$ is on Instagram (<a href=#>@jutesmusic</a>).

His most recent song, Hollywood Hillbilly, is the lead single from his new album, which will be released in October. The following single from Jute$ will be released on October 1st, 2022.</p><p>Top songs from the early 2020 album include the classics Sideshow and Start Over, which combine trap beats with edgy lyrics to evoke the rock culture of the early 2000s. His second album, A Really Bad Dream, debuted not long after this first album.</p><p>The Nuance Magazine said that Jutes’ style is the same, but he uses more experimental techniques. This music hinted at what his fans may expect in his future music projects.

Calling it “one of the fav songs I’ve ever worked on,” Jute$ wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> about the experience. “I remember thinking wtf am I supposed to do in a Demi Lovato session,” he questioned. “Only to show up and realize she was making one of the hardest rock projects I’ve ever heard.”</p><p>Moreover, the music video for Jute$’s song Funeral, dropped in October 2021, made numerous religious undertones. You can find him on <a href=#>Spotify</a>, <a href=#>SoundCloud</a>, and <a href=#>YouTube</a>. Some of his popular songs are “BOY WITH A BROKEN HEART,” “Give u a Call,” and “Say it Out Loud”.</p><p>Besides music, he is also on a mission to become substance-free in 2022. On 18 May 2022, he celebrated being 30 days sober. He added, “[The] longest I’ve gone since high school. Alcohol was my last remaining vice I used to deal [with] my anxiety and mental s***.
