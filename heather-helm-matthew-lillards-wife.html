He included some lovely remarks in the caption that captured his years-long adventure with his Helm. He penned</p><p>When we first met, when we said “yes,” and right now. When you’re married to your closest friend, the twenty years fly by. Hey Heather Lillard, I adore you.</p><p>Speaking about their initial encounter, they said it happened at a party. It is said that as soon as Heather revealed that she was attending her friend’s wedding in Italy, Matthew fell head over heels in love with Helm and extended an invitation to attend.</p><p>Her three children are under her care.</p><p>The lovely Heather is a mother of three children. Addison Grace Lillard, her first child, was born in 2002 as a daughter and weighed 6 pounds, 10 ounces. In 2004, she brought her second daughter Macey into the world.
