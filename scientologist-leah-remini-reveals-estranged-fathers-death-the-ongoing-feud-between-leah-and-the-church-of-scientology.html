The two were not in touch with one another which caused Leah to hear about the news late.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Leah-Reminis-biological-father-dies-without-her-knowledge.jpg><p>Leah took to Instagram to lament about her late father. She posted a very lengthy caption where she detailed her current state of mind and also blamed the Church of Scientology for their broken relationship.</p><p>Leah not only didn’t know about her father’s demise but was also not aware of his sickness leading to his demise.</p><p>She captioned,</p><p>“On Friday, I received a message from my sister Nicole, who had been contacted by a stranger passing on his condolences for the passing of our father, George Anthony Remini.&nbsp;We had no idea that he had died a month ago. We weren’t aware that he had been sick leading up to his death. A funeral came and went and none of us knew anything about it. We were not able to say goodbye. He was not able to redeem himself, to ask for forgiveness for his failures and hurts, to become a better man to those of us who couldn’t help but love him,”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Leah-Remini-blames-The-Church-of-Scientology-for-her-estranged-relation-with-her-dad.jpg><p>She added,</p><p>“If you read my book, you’ll know my father and I had a difficult relationship, but I always forgave him with a daughter’s painfully endless love and hope,”(referencing&nbsp;her 2015 book,&nbsp;Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology, which chronicles her split from Scientology”) “Regardless of his neglect and abuse, I had hoped to one day have some closure. I hoped for him to acknowledge who he had been and what he had done to us as his children. That alone would have been healing in its own way. We never got that, yet I can’t help but grieve.”</p><p>She admitted,</p><p>” I am angry at myself for crying for someone who didn’t ever cry for me. I am angry that I still wanted this man’s love. I’m angry that the last chapter in our relationship was dictated by Scientology. Scientology took my dad in as a pawn against me and likely robbed him of any last ounce of heart that might have been left in him. I’m angry that Scientology found his personal weak spots and got him on board not with their beliefs but with their smear campaign against me, “</p><p>“Knowing my father, after taking the offer from Scientology to betray me, he wouldn’t have thought that he could ever come back from that in our relationship. If he thought that, though, he would have been wrong,” she concluded. “I would have forgiven him as I always did. The little girls inside of my sisters and me will never forgive Scientology for taking away our last chance to have the one thing we always wanted from our father… And that was for him to say ‘I’m sorry and I loved you.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_ongoing_feud_between_Leah_and_the_Church_of_Scientology></span>The ongoing feud between Leah and the Church of Scientology!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In her official statement regarding her father’s death, she blamed the Church of Scientology for their broken relations.</p><p>However, the organization was quick to respond to her allegations. The church stated that her words were very hypocritical to the situation.</p><p>The spokesperson reportedly told PEOPLE,</p><p>“Leah Remini blames everyone but herself for destroying her relationships. It’s beyond hypocritical. She was estranged from her father, who was never a member of the religion, for years and now even exploits his sad passing for tabloid attention.”</p><p>Leah herself was a member of the Church of Scientology till 2013. She officially split from the organization in 2013 after being a member for 35 years.</p><p>Since her departure, she has been very vocal about criticizing the organization. And now along with her father’s death, she and the organization is going through a bit of a feud.</p><p>Also, read about&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity chef Carl Ruiz dies suddenly at age 44!
