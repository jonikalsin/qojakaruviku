A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie showers $20K on dancers as Travis Scott lays low</h1><div id=sub-header>September 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>New York's Sapphire club continues to see a spike in big names making appearances and dropping a bomb when it comes to thanking the entertainers for their dances. Located all the way in a posh Upper East Side neighborhood, the club was recently graced by the presence of rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie who reportedly spent close to "twenty grand" in singles, at dancers in the crowd. The rapper had initially visited for a performance and according to sources, whatever he had allegedly made from performing, he blew it all up on the dancers.</p><p>News of Hoodie's stint at Sapphire comes after rappers <a href=# rel>Ice-T</a> and Treach had also reportedly visited the jiggle joint. Boogie was filling in for Nas, who was promoted to perform and host the weekly 'Sins' party at the venue, had to pull out. Hoodie however wasn't the only famous name in the crowd as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Page Six</a> reports <a href=# rel>Nelly</a> arrived with Trey Songz and <a href=# rel>Busta Rhymes</a>, who's reportedly a Sapphire regular, was apparently seen walking around with two bottles of champagne. With big names galore, and hours that range from 6 PM to 4 AM in the morning, it's understandable why Sapphire has become such a hotspot for blowing steam - or dollars. And owner Pete Feinstein is somehow still surprised by certain big names throwing fake money around the place.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Baltimore strip club sues mayor over Covid-19 ban, Internet says strippers finally have 'time to go to college'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Who owns Satin Dolls? How 'The Sopranos' strip club where Marko Guberovic was killed is linked to real-life mafia</a></p><h2 class=split>Who owns Sapphire?</h2><p>Full name Sapphire Gentlemen's Club, the luxe entertainment joint brags not only of exclusive and cut-out indulgences, but also the 'sexiest steaks' in town, on their website. Promising a galore of adult entertainers, personal dancers, and everything one would imagine in a posh business frequented by celebrity rappers, Sapphire originated all the way in Las Vegan, before their grand opening in New York that has now grown to three different outlets: Sapphie Sixtieth, Sapphire Times Square, and Sapphire Thirty-Nine. All three are ultimately owned by the boss who began it all - Peter Feinstein.&nbsp;</p><p>Feinstein's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LinkedIn</a> account calls him a current partner at Sapphire, where the seasoned business mogul describes himself as: "Experienced Partner with a demonstrated history of working in the entertainment industry. Strong entrepreneurship professional skilled in Negotiation, Sales, Hospitality Industry, Market Research, and Management." Feinstein had made headlines earlier this year when Usher had reportedly visited the Las Vegas chapter of the strip club and rained fake money with some publicity. “I thought it was a joke when I first heard about it,” Feinstein had told the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a> in April after the odd visit. “I guess part of his entourage came in with a briefcase full of these ‘Ushbucks’ and they were passing them around. Now I’m getting all these calls from all these different news outlets interested in what happened," he had added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b9c21e4b-18b3-43d4-84b2-766fc62326ab.1252814966><h2 class=split>Travis Scott stayed 'low-key'</h2><p>Hoodie's recent splurge on the dancers however didn't include any money that's been reported fake. “He bought 20 grand in singles and was throwing it to dancers in the crowd. It’s like everything he made on performing, he pretty much spent on dancers,” a source told Page Six. Another added: "He threw a brick of five grand and it landed on a girl’s head! It was quite funny … the crowd went crazy with all the money flying in the air.”</p><p>Travis Scott, who's rumored to have reconciled with billionaire baby-mama Kylie Jenner, was also present albeit "low key" at the venue. Sources told Page Six, “he was shooing a lot of girls away," adding that Scott "Kind of didn’t want to be bothered. He was in the corner … they sneaked him in through a backdoor, and his security went in first to pick out an area,” our source said. But while Scott continues to make hush-hush appearances at strip joints, a Jenner is on the prowl to DJ at an end of the month 'Sins' party at Sapphire. Of course, it's not the Kylie Cosmetics founder; it's her half-brother Brody Jenner instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikerDDzaxkrJmgpbWqvsRmqq2qmaV6pLjUm2Sbp5%2BZtqZ51qKrZqCfpLGqsYxrZ2afopa7pXnDmqWcnaKoerW%2BwK%2BgrGWjmLy1wIylprBlm5rGbrzErZyrZZaatrS6056gpw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./valerie-jarrett-religion-is-she-muslim-or-christian-or-jewish-ethnicity.html>&#171;&nbsp;Valerie Jarrett Religion: Is She Muslim Or Christian Or Jewish?
