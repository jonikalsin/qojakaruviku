The 28-year-old country music star behind the “Wilder Days” hit is enjoying as much of the year as she can before undergoing a double mastectomy as a precaution against breast cancer. “I had the BRCA gene,” she told Page Six at London’s Highways Festival on May 20. “It’s a breast cancer gene, so I’m having a double mastectomy in November. I’m going really hard up until November, so then November and December, I have off to rest.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/morgan-wade-5-things-to-know-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that produce proteins that help repair damaged DNA, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>National Cancer Institute</a>. However, when someone inherits a harmful variant of one of these genes, they have an increased risk of several cancers, most notably breast and ovarian cancers. Morgan is not leaving anything up to chance. “I’m feeling fine. I’m just pissed I won’t be able to work out because I really like working out,” she told Page Six about her upcoming operation, adding that she usually works out seven days a week. “That’s my only qualm about it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>More so, Morgan has become&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>‘ new bestie and has taken to social media in recent months to share a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>plethora of photos</a> with the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RHOBH&nbsp;</a>star. Below are five things to know about the songstress!</p><h2><strong>Morgan Wade Is A Country Star</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Morgan’s career began in 2018 when she was a freshman in college. She recorded and released her debut album. While performing at the ’18 FloydFest, <strong>Jason Isbell</strong>‘s sound engineer gave her album to <strong>Sadler Vaden</strong>, guitarist for Isbell’s band, <strong>The 400 Unit</strong>. Sadler and producer <strong>Paul Ebersold </strong>knew that Morgan had it, and they worked with her to put together Reckless, her debut major-label album. Thirty Tigers put it out in 2021, which earned major critical acclaim.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“With insider trade HITS proclaiming, ‘Imagine Kris Kristofferson as a Gen Z woman,’ The New York Times raving, ‘she sounds like she’s singing from the depths of history,’ and FADER offering, ‘Wade has a voice like a jagged blade, sharp enough to draw blood but lustrous under the light,’ Reckless landed hard and true,” reads the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bio on her website</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Reckless gave a Top 40 hit for Morgan. “Wilder Days” peaked at No. 36 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><h2><strong>She’s Pretty Fearless</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/morgan-wade-5-things-to-know-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>“The first time I sang in front of people I just went down into this basement with five random men that I found on Craigslist to start a band,” Morgan told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>. At the time, she was a 19-year-old student attending college in Roanoke, Virginia. “I just remember there was a guy sitting out front with sunglasses on at eight o’clock at night, smoking weed. That was really normal. And I just went on in the house, and they were like, ‘Yeah, down in the basement.’ So I went down there, and there were five guys down there. But, here we are.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The Craigslist band helped Morgan record her first album, the self-released Puppets With My Heart. She told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> that the album came from a moment of heartbreak after dumping a boyfriend. “I just got it in my head that I could form a band,” Wade recalls. “It would either piss him off or get him back, either one.”</p><h2>Morgan Wade Is Friends With Kyle Richards</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Not only is Morgan famous in her own right, but she’s also one of Kyle Richards’ new pals! In Dec. 2022, the&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;star even took to Instagram to wish Morgan a happy birthday. “Happy birthday @morganwademusic May all your dreams continue to come true! Keep shining We love you,” the Bravo personality captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>carousel of photos</a>. More recently, on Apr. 28, 2023, Morgan took to Instagram to hilariously mock Kyle’s lavish Birkin bag. “I ain’t first class but I ain’t white trash. When @kylerichards18 leaves her bag to go to the bathroom,” she captioned<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> the video</a>. The ladies even took a chic vacation to Mexico in Jan. 2023 (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video here</a>.)</p><h2><strong>Morgan Decided To Get A Double Mastectomy Due To Her Family History</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>In May 2023, Morgan revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a> that she found out that she has “the BRCA gene.” Everyone has two copies of these genes – one inherited from each parent, per the National Cancer Institute. &nbsp;BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that help repair damaged DNA, and are considered tumor suppressor genes. Yet, when they have certain changes – considered harmful variants or mutations – they can develop cancers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>People who inherited harmful variants are at risk of several cancers, most notably breast and ovarian cancer. People with harmful variants of BRCA1/BRCA2 tend to develop cancer at younger ages. “My mom had [cancer], and my little cousin is going to get it, but I’ll be fine,” said Morgan. She opted to undergo a double mastectomy as a preventative measure.</p><h2><strong>Her Second Major Label Album Promised To Go Crazy</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Rolling Stone named Reckless as the Best Country Album of 2021. The follow-up, Psychopath, was set for an August 2023 release date. “With ‘Psychopath,’ we’ve done a really good job of moving on from Reckless&nbsp;to the next stage without it being so crazy different,” she told Page Six in May 2023. “I’m excited. Every song on there has its own sound and is completely different. … [The album] goes into where I’m at in life right now. Which is so busy. It’s about growing up and being older and starting to feel like, ‘Is it time to settle down?’ I think you’ll see a lot of that on the record.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6sL7GmqVmr5GZsm6BkGlsbHBlZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jim-abbott-net-worth-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jim Abbott Net Worth</a>
