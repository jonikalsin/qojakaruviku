Dennis Wilson,<span>&nbsp;<a href=#>brother of Brian Wilson</a>, was a co-founder of The Beach Boys; Charles Manson, on the other hand, is perhaps the most famous (certainly the most infamous) cult leader in American history. On his orders, Manson's followers -- the "Manson Family" as they were known -- carried out the <a href=#>Tate-Labianca murders</a> in 1969, leaving seven people dead, including actress Sharon Tate.

While living with Dennis Wilson, Charles Manson and his swarm of STD-infested scavengers relentlessly took advantage of Wilson’s kindness. They destroyed his home, his cars, and his credit. Wilson, who died in 1983 after a long struggle with addiction, never recovered from his time spent living with the family, and blamed himself for the deaths that occurred after the Manson Family moved from his home in the Palisades to the emptiness of Spahn Ranch.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Two Hitchhikers Introduced Wilson To Manson</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/e1ef65d58df73dbf072993a153d98cea.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>Dennis Wilson may never have met Charles Manson if he hadn’t been so prone to picking up hitchhikers, especially young female hitchhikers.
